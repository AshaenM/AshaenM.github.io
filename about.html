                    Hello, my name is Ashaen Manuel, and I am a 21-year-old
                    aspiring Game Developer. My passion for creating immersive
                    experiences and my fascination with software development
                    sparked at the age of 16 when I decided to pursue game
                    development as my career.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Driven by creativity and a love for problem-solving, I enjoy
                    turning innovative ideas into reality through code. My
                    journey combines a deep appreciation for gaming with the
                    technical skills needed to bring those visions to life. I am
                    committed to building engaging, high-quality games with cutting-edge technology.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer
                    Science, majoring in Games Development, at Swinburne
                    University of Technology, Australia. This program has
                    provided me with invaluable experiences, equipping me with
                    the skills to tackle complex and innovative projects. These
                    projects, many of which showcase my creativity and technical
                    expertise, can be found on my GitHub portfolio.
